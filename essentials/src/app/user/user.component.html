    We should use string interpolation when using between tags.
    In case we have to use string interpolation for the html attributes,then wrap the attribute with square braces
    like we did in case of src attribute of img tag. 

    This is also called property binding

    <!--Attribute Binding
In the previous lecture, you were introduced to "Property Binding" - a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties 
to dynamic values.

For example, <img [src]="someSrc"> binds the src property of the underlying HTMLImageElement DOM object to the value stored in someSrc.

Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the <img> tag, you're actually NOT doing that. Instead, property binding 
really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called src) and binds that.

This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between
 element attributes and property. This article can help with understanding this difference.

Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements 
dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.

For example, when binding ARIA attributes, you can't target an underlying DOM object property.

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a 
slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.

It looks like this:

<div 
  role="progressbar" 
  [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal" 
  [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal">...</div>
By adding attr in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're "telling" Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute - in the example above, the aria-valuenow and aria-valuemax attributes would be bound dynamically.-->
       

<!-- <img [src]=" '/assets/users/' + selectedUser.avatar" [alt]="selectedUser.name"> -->
 <!-- In the below code everytime execution of src property binding is done which is cumbersome and 
 takes time to load on page.
 Better we can use Getters for computed Values. -->
<img [src]="imagePath" [alt]="selectedUser.name">
        <!-- <img src="{{ selectedUser.avatar}}" /> -->
        <span>{{selectedUser.name}}</span>
    </button>
</div>
